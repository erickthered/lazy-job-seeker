# Lazy Job Seeker

Lazy Job Seeker in an app built on top of Torre.co API endpoints that
aims to make it easier to find job opportunities at Torre.  It aims
to help a "lazy job seeker" see what opportunities are a better match
according to his/her strengths.

The idea is simple, the user will input it's username, the app will
fetch the user data from Torre, then the list of his/her skills will
be displayed as a set of "chips".

Clicking on top of these "chips" will enable/disable each of the skills
as part of the filter that will be applied to the list of opportunities
that are displayed below the list of "chips"

The list of OPEN positions will have a tab on top in order to select
the type of possition (e.g. full-time, part-time, freelance, internship)
and a switch to view only remote positions (keep in mind our job seeker
is lazy).  The fields that will be displayed are simple: company, job
name or title, number of required skills, match percent and a link to
see the opportunity details at Torre.
